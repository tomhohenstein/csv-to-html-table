# Do They Have a Data Policy? 

This repository is an attempt to gather research data policies from various institutions. It was started at BU when we attempted to locate research data policies from numberous institutions to help inform our own policies and processes. Gathering this type of information is laborious and not that much fun. It became apparent that others might be interested in this information, could help us verify our findings, and provide new information about other institutions. 

## How to contribute

If you would like to update our data set. Please [add an issue](https://github.com/tomhohenstein/do-they-have-a-data-policy/issues)(preferred!) or [email me](mailto:tah@bu.edu).

We are always looking for:

+ New institutions and their data policy status
+ Verification of our findings
+ General assistance editing and making out data set clearer. 

## The Data

The data is organized as follows 

|Column   | Value | Definition (if needed) |

| Institution  | Name of the institution   |   |
