# Do They Have a Data Policy? 

This repository is an attempt to gather research data policies from various institutions. It was started at BU when we attempted to locate policies of various institutions to help inform our own policies and processes. It became apparent that others might be interested in this information, could help us verify our findings, and provide new information about other institutions. 

## How to contribute

If you would like to update our data set. Please [add an issue](https://github.com/tomhohenstein/do-they-have-a-data-policy/issues)(preferred!) or [email me](mailto:tah@bu.edu).
